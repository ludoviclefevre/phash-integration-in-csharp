===========================

This is a sample project to show how to integrate pHash library in a C# project.

Open it in Visual Studio 2012.

More information about pHash:

> pHash (http://www.phash.org) is an implementation of various perceptual hashing algorithms. A perceptual hash is a fingerprint of a multimedia file derived from various features from its content. Unlike cryptographic hash functions that rely on the avalanche effect of small changes in input leading to drastic changes in the output, perceptual hashes are "close" to one another if the features are similar. Potential applications include copyright protection, similarity searches for media files, or even digital forensics.
